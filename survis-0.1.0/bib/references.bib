  title = {Artificial neural Network−Genetic algorithm modeling for moisture content prediction of savory leaves drying process in different drying conditions},
  Abstract = {In this study, the application of a versatile approach for modeling and prediction of the moisture content of dried savory leaves using hybrid artificial neural network-genetic algorithm has been presented. Genetic Algorithm was used in order to find the best Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) structure for modeling and estimation of moisture content in the drying process of savory leaves. The experiments were performed at three air temperatures of 40, 60 and 80 °C and at three levels of relative humidity 20%, 30% and 40% and air velocity of 1, 1.5 and 2.0 m/s for drying the savory leaves in the forced conductive dryer. Optimized neural network by GA had two hidden layers with 9 and 17 neurons in first and second hidden layers, respectively. Mean Square Error (MSE) value (0.000094606) and correlation coefficient (0.9992) of FFNN-GA experiments showed that moisture content can be accurately predicted from the input variables: air temperature, airflow velocity, relative humidity and drying time. Moreover, results showed that the optimized neural network topology could denote the superior ability of this intelligent model for on-line prediction of the moisture content of Savory leaves in different drying conditions.},

  abstract = {Characteristics of thin layer microwave drying of apple pomace with and without hot air pre-drying were evaluated in a laboratory scale microwave dryer. The drying experiments were carried out at 150, 300, 450 and 600W, and the hot air pre-drying experiment was performed at 105°C. Ten commonly used mathematical models were evaluated with the experimental data. The results indicated that the Page model was most adequate in predicting moisture transfer for fresh and pre-dried apple pomace; just a falling rate period was observed in the microwave drying processes; in comparison with the fresh apple pomace, the drying times, or the energy consumptions in the drying of pre-dried apple pomace to remove the same moisture (40%, wb) decreased by 25% on the average at the experimental power levels, and their values of effective diffusivity were higher, which indicates that the pre-treatment with hot air drying can improve the microwave drying rate of apple pomace; four regression equations of drying rate against drying duration or moisture were found to describe very well the drying characteristics for fresh and pre-treated apple pomace respectively; it took nearly 70% of total drying time to remove the latter half of moisture (wb) in the microwave drying with or without pre-drying. The above findings can facilitate the design and operation of microwave drying of apple pomace.},

  abstract = {The drying kinetics of the red bell pepper (var. Lamuyo) was studied and modeled at different temperatures (50, 60, 70 and 80°C), using an air velocity of 2.5ms−1. Only the falling rate period could be observed during the experiment. Effective moisture diffusivity was estimated to be between 3.2×10−9 and 11.2×10−9m2s−1 within the temperature range studied. The effect of temperature on the diffusivity was described by the Arrhenius equation with an activation energy (Ea) of 39.70kJmol−1. The Newton, Henderson–Pabis, Page and Page modified models were applied to the experimentally obtained moisture data. The fit quality of the models was evaluated using the correlation coefficient, sum square error, root mean square error, and Chi-square. Comparisons of the experimental values with the calculated values demonstrated that the Page modified model produced the best fit for every drying curve, representing an excellent tool for estimation of the drying time.}

  abstract = {In order to determine the behaviour of fruits during drying under natural conditions, open-air sun drying experiments were conducted on apricots pre-sulphured with SO2 or NaHSO3, grapes, peaches, figs and plums, in the ranges of 27–43 °C ambient temperature and 0.72–2.93 MJ/m2h solar radiation. The drying rate curves of these fruits contained no constant rate period, but showed a falling rate period. Twelve mathematical models were tested to fit the drying rates of the fruits. Among the models, the approximation of the diffusion model for apricots (non-pre-treated or SO2-sulphured) and figs, the modified Henderson and Pabis model for apricot (NaHSO3-sulphured), grape and plum, and the model given by Verma et al. for peach were found to best explain one layer open sun drying behaviour of the fruits. The effects of surface temperature of the fruits and relative humidity just above their surface on the constants and coefficients of the selected models were also studied by multiple regression analysis. In studying the consistency of all the models, some statistical tests, such as χ2, MBE and RMSE were also used as well as correlation coefficients. The results of these tests have also confirmed the consistency of the selected models.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study presented both the empirical and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches to estimate the moisture content of Mentha spicata. Two different types of drying methods (in shade and in oven (35 and 50°C)) were used to investigate the drying kinetics of the Mentha spicata samples. The effects of drying methods on effective diffusion coefficient, moisture ratio (MR), drying rate, and activation energy were investigated. Moreover, six different thin layer drying models (Page, Diffusion approach, Newton, Modified Henderson, Henderson and Pabis and Pabis and Midilli) and an ANN with feed forward structure were used to define the drying kinetics of these samples. In order to estimate the kinetic model parameters, sequential quadratic programming (SQP) was used. Model performances were evaluated based on the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE\%) values. In the kinetic part of the modeling study, the Midilli model provided better results than the others. However, the ANN had the best results when a total assessment was made. The effective diffusion coefficient values were found in the range between 1.31 × 10–12 and 4.43 × 10–12 m2/s. The activation energy was obtained as 44.31 kJ/kmol. The R2, MAPE\%, and RMSE values for the ANN test data were 1.00, 0.2257, and 5.9447 × 10−4, respectively. In the future, different modeling approaches will be applied to describe this drying process. Practical applications Drying is a process where heat transfer and mass transfer take place together. Modeling is an innovative approach used in evaluation of experimental data and has increasing popularity in recent years. ANNs are a powerful data-driven method, and they have a very broad area of usage from medicine to engineering issues. Empirical models are another approach for describing experimental data. In this study, these two modeling approaches were used to obtain the MR. Humidity is a condition that needs to be checked in food safety and protection. Therefore, it is very important to ensure control with robust modeling techniques. In this study, the developed ANN model had a high R2 value (R2 = 1.00). This indicated that it may be used successfully in real applications.},

  abstract = { AbstractIn current work, the energy and exergy analysis of hot air impingement drying mushroom slices was conducted under different air temperature (55, 60, 65, 70, and 75 °C), air velocity (3, 6, 9, and 12 m/s), and sample thickness (6, 9, and 12 mm) by the first and second law of thermodynamics. The statistical analysis results indicated that the effect of air velocity and temperature on the energy and exergy was more important than the sample thickness on it. The energy utilization and energy utilization ratio were in the range of 0.067–0.859 kJ/s and 0.087–0.34, respectively. The exergy loss and exergy efficiency was varied from 0.045–0.571 kJ/s and 0.315–0.879, respectively. Besides, the artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to predict the energy and exergy parameters. The modeling results revealed that the ANN models with arranged training algorithms and transfer function could be utilized to predict the performance of hot air impingement drying system with satisfactory accuracy. },

  abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to develop and apply an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model for predicting the drying characteristics of potato, garlic and cantaloupe at convective hot air dryer. Drying experiments were conducted at the air temperatures of 40, 50, 60 and 70 °C and the air speeds of 0.5, 1 and l.5 m/s. Drying properties were including kinetic drying, effective moisture diffusivity (Deff) and specific energy consumption (SEC). The highest value of Deff obtained 9.76 × 10−9, 0.13 × 10−9 and 9.97 × 10−10 m2/s for potato, garlic, and cantaloupe, respectively. The lowest value of SEC for potato, garlic, and cantaloupe were calculated 1.94 × 105, 4.52 × 105 and 2.12 × 105 kJ/kg, respectively. Results revealed that the ANFIS model had the high ability to predict the Deff (R2 = 0.9900), SEC (R2 = 0.9917), moisture ratio (R2 = 0.9974) and drying rate (R2 = 0.9901) during drying.

  abstract = {Mapping the drying characteristics of biological products is essential for drying time estimation and reduction of energy consumption. The knowledge of mass transfer parameters during different drying conditions is required for process and equipment design and is of great industrial importance. In this work, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was adopted to model the vacuum drying kinetics of moringa leaves. Levenberg–Marquardt’s training algorithm with LOGSIGMOID and TANSIGMOID hidden layer transfer functions gave superior results for the prediction of moisture content and moisture ratio, respectively. Further, a comparative evaluation of the predictive capability of ANN and 7 different semi-empirical models was performed. The Page model was found suitable to fit the experimental data with a R2 comparable to that of ANN. However, the MSE observed for ANN (1.05 × 10−6) was significantly lower than that of Page model (2.56 × 10-6 to 5.81 × 10-4). Effective moisture diffusivity and mass transfer coefficient increased with increase in temperature from 0.71 × 10-9 to 1.91 × 10-9  m2/s and, 1.07 × 10-7 to 4.07 × 10-7 m/s, respectively. Activation energy for drying of moringa leaves was calculated as 42.84 kJ/mol which showed moderate energy requirements for moisture diffusion. Specific energy consumed was directly affected by drying time and varied from 6.07 to 22.26 kW h/kg. Drying temperature of 60 °C resulted in higher drying rate, lower drying time and energy consumption and therefore, recommended for drying of Moringa olifera leaves.},
